# Twenty One Hundred

**The year is 2100. The future is yours to restore.**

The world stands on the edge between ruin and renewal — a fragile planet shaped by the choices of those who came before. Rusting cities pierce a hazy sky, oceans swallow the bones of coastal empires, and the air hums with the ghosts of industry. Yet amid the wreckage, sparks of hope remain.

In Twenty One Hundred, you are the Reader — the unseen force guiding humanity’s future through the echoes of a broken Earth. Every decision you make ripples through time: will you rebuild with renewable energy, foster peace among nations, restore lost species, or let civilization fade into dust?

Your actions shape more than cities and ecosystems - they define the soul of humanity itself. The world remembers every choice, weaving them into a living tapestry of recovery, equality, and survival.

Will you heal the planet… or simply repeat the mistakes of the past?
